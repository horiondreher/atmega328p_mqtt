# atmega328p_mqtt

Using the MQTT client, this software was developed to control the basic elements of a house. All these elements are controlled by a app on Android. The app control the lights, the gate, shows the temperature of a room and control the RFID to open a door, given the person that's allowed to enter.

The hardware used for this project is basically composed of a ATmega328P microcontroller, the ENC28J60 ethernet module and MFRC522 RFID module.
The microcontroller software was developed using the Atmel Studio (AVR-GCC) and the app software using the Android Studio.
